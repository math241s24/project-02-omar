# Proposal

In this project, the goal is to create some interesting and interactive visualizations for analysis of international air travel in the United States. 

## Dataset

```{r data loading, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = FALSE, results = FALSE}

dotair2023 <- read_csv("data/us-dot-air-intl-2023.csv")
```

Below is monthly data about international air travel in all of the United States from 1990 to 2023:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
glimpse(dotair2023)
```

The data used for this project will have 766,693 rows and 16 columns and is sourced from the Department of Transportation.
